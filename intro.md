# WELCOME üëã

---------------

## Let's get you set up.

- Download and install [Anaconda](www.anaconda.com).
- Run Anaconda Navigator. - windows: CMD.exe prompt

---------------

## Install the following packages using Anaconda's package manager

(some of these are installed by default)

Go into the Anaconda command prompt and install the missing packages.

- Spyder (usually already installed)
- `conda install -c conda-forge bash` or `conda install -c msys2 m2-base` on Windows.
- `conda install -c conda-forge pip`
- `conda install -c conda-forge git`

---------------

## Before we move on let's get you a GitHub account

- GitHub is a website that hosts `git` repositories.
- `git` is a version controlling software for your source code.
- Every repository is independent and decentralized, conflicts must be resolved
    by you.
- Go to [GitHub.com](GitHub.com) and register for an account.

---------------

## Now go to our summer school git repository and give it a star ‚≠ê

- [github.com/AetherModel/Space-Weather-Simulation-Summer-School](https://github.com/AetherModel/Space-Weather-Simulation-Summer-School)

---------------

## Now *fork* it üç¥ - creates a copy that is in my own directory

- Forking makes a copy of the repository for your own account.
- Do this when making contributions to open source project to merge back one
    day!

---------------

## *Clone* it into your PC

---------------

- Every git repository is independent but they can be cloned!
- Good science is done more easily with good organization. Find a good folder in
    your computer to clone.

---------------

## Let's configure git first

- `git config --global user.name '<full name>'` keeonnfong
- `git config --global user.email '<email>'` keeonnfong@gmail.com

---------------


## `mkdir` and `cd`

- To create directories type `mkdir <directory_name>`
- To move into a directory type `cd <directory_name>`
- Most terminals allow tab-completion! Use that to your advantage.

---------------

- Finally when you are in the folder you want to use for your work
- `git clone <clone_link>`
